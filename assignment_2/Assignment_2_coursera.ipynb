    "For this question, we're going to use the `validation_curve` function in `sklearn.model_selection` to determine training and test scores for a Support Vector Classifier (`SVC`) with varying parameter values.  Recall that the validation_curve function, in addition to taking an initialized unfitted classifier object, takes a dataset as input and does its own internal train-test splits to compute results.\n",

    "The initialized unfitted classifier object we'll be using is a Support Vector Classifier with radial basis kernel.  So your first step is to create an `SVC` object with default parameters (i.e. `kernel='rbf', C=1`) and `random_state=0`. Recall that the kernel width of the RBF kernel is controlled using the `gamma` parameter.  \n",

Recall that you can specify what scoring metric you want validation_curve to use by setting the \"scoring\" parameter.  In this case, we want to use \"accuracy\" as the scoring metric.\n",
