## Applied Machine Learning in Python

This repo contains my solution to the four programming assignments of this
course. For each assignment, I have two Jupyter notebooks. One was developed in
my local environment, and the other was created inside Coursera's environment.
Obviously, these notebooks are very similar. However, often my local notebook
has details I cannot include in the Coursera version (the autograder would
consider my code to be wrong).

The Jupyter notebooks created in my local environment can be found here:

* [Assignment 1](https://github.com/mwoitek/applied-text-mining/blob/main/assignment_1/Assignment_1_local.ipynb)
* [Assignment 2](https://github.com/mwoitek/applied-text-mining/blob/main/assignment_2/Assignment_2_local.ipynb)
* [Assignment 3](https://github.com/mwoitek/applied-text-mining/blob/main/assignment_3/Assignment_3_local.ipynb)
* Assignment 4

The corresponding Coursera versions are listed below:

* [Assignment 1](https://github.com/mwoitek/applied-text-mining/blob/main/assignment_1/Assignment_1_coursera.ipynb)
* [Assignment 2](https://github.com/mwoitek/applied-text-mining/blob/main/assignment_2/Assignment_2_coursera.ipynb)
* [Assignment 3](https://github.com/mwoitek/applied-text-mining/blob/main/assignment_3/Assignment_3_coursera.ipynb)
* Assignment 4
